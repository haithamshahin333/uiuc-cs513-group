### Description

The New York Public Library (NYPL) Menu Collection represents a comprehensive digitization project of historical restaurant menus spanning from the mid-19th century to the early 21st century. This dataset captures the culinary landscape of American dining, with particular emphasis on New York establishments, hotels, steamships, and special events. The collection spans across 3 centuries, from 1800s to 2000s (it is worth noting there appears to be data error since earliest record of menu is year 01 and latest is later than current year of 2025), with the majority of menus dating from 1880-1980. This dataset includes a wide variety of venue types (commercial restaurants, hotels, etc.), meal types (breakfast, lunch, etc.) and physical metadata (detailed descriptions of menu design, materials, and artistic elements).

## Part 2: Develop three use cases

### Task 2a: Target (main) use case

Main Use Case U1:

Key Question: How have dish prices changed with time and how do they differ across menu locations.

One hypothetical use case for the dataset is wanting to understand how the same dish is priced different both with variance in time and variance in menu location.
This use case requires necessary data cleansing to first standardize the set of dishes such that syntax issues or differences in language used for a given dish that represent the same semantic dish are matched.
Next, the data needs to be validated to ensure that year and price are valid values in the dataset. Additionally, the menu locations and venues need to be validated as real locations on the map.
It is also necessary to ensure that dishes can be mapped back to their origin menus since this link is how a given dish can be compared across locations.

Query Samples (In Natural Language):

1) Select avg(price) for dishes grouped by decades for a given country -> This helps to show how in a particular location dish prices changed over time
2) Select top(prices) for each dish in a given decade, country -> helps to show how prices changed for a dish in a given country over each decade
3) Select avg(prices) for each country across decades -> show how prices changed across dishes in each country over time

### Task 2b: "Zero Data Cleaning" Use Case (U0)

Scenario: A library science researcher wants to analyze the digitization quality and completeness of the NYPL menu collection to assess the success of the crowdsourcing project and identify patterns in volunteer contributions.

The analysis requirements are to (1) analyze completion status using the `status` field ("complete" vs "under review") and (2) compare digitization quality metrics using `page_count` and `dish_count` fields.

Zero data cleaning is sufficient because (1) the `status` field provides direct categorical data ("complete", "under review") that requires no standardization for analysis and (2) the `page_count` and `dish_count` fields contain clean numerical data suitable for statistical analysis without modification. In Menu.csv, there are no rows with empty values in `status`, `page_count` and `dish_count` columns.

### Task 2c: "Never Enough" Use Case (U2)

Scenario: A public health researcher wants to conduct a comprehensive nutritional analysis of American dining patterns over the past 150 years to model the evolution of dietary habits and nutritional content. The goal is to correlate historical dietary patterns with health outcomes and inform modern public health policy.

The analysis requirements are to (1) calculate nutritional content (calories, macronutrients, vitamins, minerals) for each dish and (2) standardize ingredient lists and cooking methods across time periods

Data cleaning is never sufficient because (1) The dataset contains dish names and brief descriptions but lacks the detailed ingredient lists, portion sizes, and preparation methods necessary for nutritional analysis. For example, "Chicken gumbo" appears 117 times across different establishments and time periods, but without standardized recipes, nutritional content cannot be determined. (2) Menu descriptions like "Tomato aux croutons" or "Cream of new asparagus, croutons" provide insufficient detail about ingredients, quantities, or preparation methods needed for nutritional analysis. In short, there are fundamental data gap because there is no ingredient quantities or preparation methods.

## Part 3: List obvious data quality problems

Use Case: How have dish prices changed with time and how do they differ across menu locations?

Data quality problems:

1. In the Menu table, there are records that are missing currency and/or currency symbol values, making it impossible for price compariason and analysis for these records.
1. In the Menu table, there are records that have invalid currency and/or currency symbol values, like "Cent", making it impossible for price compariason and analysis for these records.
1. In the Menu table's date column, there are different format of dates, so we are not able to compare the dates for all the records.
1. In the MenuItem table, there are records that are missing price values, making it impossible for price compariason and analysis for these records.
1. Integrity Constraint check is nessasary to make sure all menu items has a corresponding dish and menu record.
1. To properly do dish price comparisons, it will be necessary to standarize/aggregate certain dishes that represent the same dish but may have different spellings or references.
1. Menu venues/locations will need to be checked for accuracy on a geographic map or against a real/historical address. This will allow for the comparison across locations.
